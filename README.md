# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

- Through the generation of **Personas and Scenarios** we have gained insight into both potential users and use cases that our website can serve. These concepts will help us develop a service that fulfills the needs and desires of our target users.
- We performed **Heuristic Analysis**, informing us on how our website will square up against big names such as Apartments.com or Zillow. This will allow us to target weaknesses in the market and bring our site up to the industry standard.
- Our **Sketches** will provide a basic framework to build the website around. These rough images give the software development team a look into the functional layout of the site and help inform future design choices.
