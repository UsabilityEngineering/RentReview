# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

In Phase III we set out to create an usability test plan with a couple of goals in our minds. Our goals were mostly formative such as what users most/least liked about different housing apps. When observing we also wanted to see how quickly users could complete specific tasks. This data will then be used for future features and patches to better our product. We had a total of 5 participants (n=5), who were classmates of ours. The main task was that participants had to find housing that is around $700/month, allows pets, and is well reviewed. Participants had to do the same task three different times on Zillow, apartments.com, and our prototype.

## Findings

Participants when tasked to find a place that allows pets on Zillow had a difficult time doing so on average. Difficulty being that they were not able to complete the task or took a notably long time. On Zillow’s listing page they have a pet option in their “more” tab, but only 1 out of 5 participants were able to find it. On the other hand, participants would manually go through entire listings to complete the task. We found that on Apartments.com, more people found the pet option. Both sites have a “more” dropdown box but users had an easier time on Apartments.com. This could be because Apartments.com only has a “more” option, while Zillow has a bunch of other drop downs which might lead the user to get lost. When participants were asked to perform the same test on our website they were able to quickly identify the pet options from our additional options drop down menu. When we designed our prototype we wanted to fit our user’s mental model, we proved it by having participants be able to complete the tasks with only their imagination.

Additionally, we found that users generally approved of the categories that we have selected for the review section. We noted that different users had different priorities in their renting experience, and these priorities were well reflected with our review system.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
