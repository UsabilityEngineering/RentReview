# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

This section of the project was focused on using our prototype in user testing to finalize changes with our website before theoretically sending it into production.

## Methods

In Phase III we set out to create an usability test plan with a couple of goals in our minds. Our goals were mostly formative such as what users most/least liked about different housing apps. When observing we also wanted to see how quickly users could complete specific tasks. This data will then be used for future features and patches to better our product. We had a total of 5 participants (n=5), who were classmates of ours. The main task was that participants had to find housing that is around $700/month, allows pets, and is well reviewed. Participants had to do the same task three different times on Zillow, apartments.com, and our prototype.

## Findings

Participants when tasked to find a place that allows pets on Zillow had a difficult time doing so on average. Difficulty being that they were not able to complete the task or took a notably long time. On Zillow’s listing page they have a pet option in their “more” tab, but only 1 out of 5 participants were able to find it. On the other hand, participants would manually go through entire listings to complete the task. We found that on Apartments.com, more people found the pet option. Both sites have a “more” dropdown box but users had an easier time on Apartments.com. This could be because Apartments.com only has a “more” option, while Zillow has a bunch of other drop downs which might lead the user to get lost. When participants were asked to perform the same test on our website they were able to quickly identify the pet options from our additional options drop down menu. Overall, users had little trouble filtering the search function on our website. When we designed our prototype we wanted to fit our user’s mental model, we proved it by having participants be able to complete the tasks with the limited scope of our prototype.

Additionally, we found that users generally approved of the categories that we have selected for the review section. We noted that different users had different priorities in their renting experience, and these priorities were well reflected with our review system. Some users in our test had difficulty finding the button for leaving review.

A number of users did have difficulty in the navigation of the property sidebar on the map page and the property homepages. This has influenced us to add additional information in the property tiles of the sidebar, and shift the review related information around on the property homepages to promote clarity.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, our prototype performed well in our particular user design test. Participants in our user test provided valuable feedback in the form of recommendations for specific changes, their navigation process of our website, and their specific backgrounds. With this feedback applied, our site should provide more clarity on the map page concerning property information and guide users more effectively to leaving reviews.

## Caveats

An important caveat of our user testing is that our users were made up of our peers. While these users did have relevant experience with renting and rental websites, as well as using them frequently, they do not represent the full scope of our potential user base. For this reason, the data we collected, while valuable, may not be accurate for a broader user base.
