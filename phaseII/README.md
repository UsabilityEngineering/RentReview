# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The second phase was focused on creating a wireframe for our website. For us, it was an aid to visualize how we wanted the contents of our website to be structured and laid out. We set out to include most of the functionality with the goal in mind that our users should be able to perform the basic task of finding a property and leaving a review. By using one of our usability techniques, the cognitive walkthrough, we were able to identify some issues in our design.

## Methods

The method that we used to discover new insights about our project is the cognitive walkthrough. The cognitive walkthrough is based on two questions “Will the user know what to do at this step?” and “If the user does the right thing, will the user know that he or she did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?” (Spencer [2000]). 

We chose people outside of our team to perform a cognitive walkthrough through the lens of the personas created in Phase 1 on the wireframe we created in Phase 2. It’s important to have people outside of our team do the walkthrough because it prevents bias. In the shoes of our personas, our peers tried to complete their tasks as if they were them. Once completed, we were able to quickly identify the areas where our wireframe needed to be refined and fixed. 

## Findings

In our findings we saw that the majority of our walkthroughs included issues with page element locations and prompts or cues absent in our design.

Many of the walkthroughs found issues with the search filtering options and their proximity to the general location search bar on the property search page. This lead to misunderstandings about the distinction between property and location search as well as the functionality of the property search filters.

There were a number of walkthroughs that had difficulty with page navigation due to a lack of prompts. Specifically, the lack of search icons or explicit search buttons threw some of the walkthroughs off. Some walkthroughs also found difficulty with discerning the purpose of the review page due to a lack of information on the page itself.

## Conclusions

Based the information gained from our methods and their findings the overall design of our application could use some modifications to element location and clarity of purpose. 

In order to reduce confusion born from element page locations, the location search bar in the property search page should be moved to the map and the property search bar should be moved next to the property search filters.

To help clarify element and page purpose, all search bars should be fleshed out with text input hints and clickable search icons to help inform users on their specific purposes. Additionally, the review page should include text input hints and better direct users to both leaving and reading reviews.

## Caveats

Our research includes a few notable caveats. First of which is that our cognitive walkthrough sample size is small. With only three walkthroughs being done we were only able to collect input from three different perspectives. It is also worth noting that these walkthroughs were generated using the personas and scenarios made by the UX team, and although they were made to represent a diverse userbase, subconscious biases from the team are likely present in them.
