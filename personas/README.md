# Scenarios

**Christine: Moving Out**

Christine is moving out of her childhood home for the first time to a college town hundreds of miles away. She can’t afford to live on her own so she’s looking for a place where she can have like-minded roommates. Budget is the primary concern for her and anything else besides cost is secondary. She would prefer a quieter part of town to avoid any distractions. Given it's her first time away from home she’d like to move into a location with management that has reviews from other first-time renters.

**David: Returning to School**

David is returning to his home town to go back to school after living in Silicon Valley for six years and is in search of an apartment. He wants a hands-off landlord who is ok with pets. He is very picky about the space and amenities of where he lives. He had a lukewarm experience with his prior rental management company so he wants to make sure that new renters will know what they’re getting into when they sign a lease with them.

**Jared: Finding a Better Neighborhood**

Jared just got a promotion at work and has decided that he can afford to move his family out of their apartment. After having a negative confrontation with his current landlord Jared is very mindful of finding a place with better management so positive reviews on that front are a must. He’d like to move to an area that has lower crime rates with a public park in walking distance that he can take his kid to.
